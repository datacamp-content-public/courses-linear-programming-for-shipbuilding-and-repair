## History of Linear Programming (LP)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f5aab26d66"
```

`@part1`
- Initially [George B. Dantzig](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/702054.pdf) 
 - During WWII, LP was used for planning complex wartime operations.
- Postwar industrialization saw a significant rise in LP use throughout most industries
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning frequently us LP concepts

With a basis from Kantorovitch's 1939 proposals, linear programming evolved out of the U.A. Air Force interest in 1947 in finding optimal time-staged deployment plans in case of war.

## What is linear programming?	

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "096a744d9e"
```

`@part1`
Linear programming is an optimization technique that uses a few inputs to determine the best way to accomplish a task.  The task could be to increase throughput, decrease cost or minimize downtime.  The inputs to linear programming are:
- What is being optimized?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the variables?

The output of linear programming is the optimal configuration to accomplish the optimization.  An example below shows the benefits of using linear programming compared to assumptions of what is best.

For this course we are working through the text [Illustrated Guide to Linear Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-Guide-Linear-Programming/dp/0486262588)

## Example

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2ab96b6b74"
```

`@part1`
A space holds three space types (A, B, C) and can have a maximum of 10 spaces total (They are all the same size).  Management wants to maximize throughput and the constraints are that each student needs to perform one of each space.  Space A takes 2 hours, B takes 4 hours and C takes 8 hours.  
Results:
![Management Group 1 vs 2, where 2 Maximizes throughput using LP.](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5020/datasets/3f84e471e2417ca82c0f58e7acb694c9f219354d/LpStudentThroughputExample.png)
